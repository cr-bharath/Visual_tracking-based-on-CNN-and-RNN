2) When creating an instance, to add GPU, first check your GPU quota. If you don`t have required quota size, submit a request 
to customer support of GCP team. Follow this stackoverflow link
https://serverfault.com/questions/887256/youve-reached-your-limit-of-0-gpus-nvidia-k80-when-start-an-instance-with-gpu-o

3) Install CUDA Toolkit 9.0 in NVIDIA K80 by following the link
https://mc.ai/deep-learning-with-google-cloud-platform-part2-how-to-install-cuda-on-your-compute-engine/

4) Pytorch version for CUDA toolkit:
Torch - 1.1.0 and Torch vision - 0.3.0
Compatabile Torch can be installed with this command
pip3 install torch==1.1.0+cu90 torchvision==0.3.0+cu90 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu90/torch_stable.html

5) Create virtual environment in GCP instance

6) Files can be uploaded directly in GUI of bucket. Mount the bucket into your instance. Steps are explained by the following tutorial

Use --implicit-dirs when you are not successful in mounting the bucket. Mounting the bucket is equivalent to physically attaching a pendrive
to your desktop.
